Let i be an integer in the\nrange 0–7. If CRM(i) = 1, CR field i (CR bits 4 * i through 4 * i + 3) is set to the contents of\nthe corresponding field of rS.\nNOTE: Updating a subset of the eight fields of the condition register may have substantially\npoorer performance on some implementations than updating all of the fields.",
